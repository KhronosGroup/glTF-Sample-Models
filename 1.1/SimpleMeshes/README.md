# SimpleMeshes

This is an example showing how the same mesh may be appended to 
several nodes, to be rendered multiple times. It also shows 
how additional vertex attributes are defined in a `mesh.primitive` - 
namely, attributes for the vertex normals. 

**Note:** The additional vertex normal attribute in this example is
not yet used by any technique. This may cause a warning to be 
printed during the validation. The normal attribute will be used in 
the [AdvancedMaterial](../AdvancedMaterial) example.
