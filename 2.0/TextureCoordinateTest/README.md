## Description

This model demonstrates the orientation of texture coordinates.  The materials and accessors have all been named according to function.  In particular, the accessor named `TopLeft_TEXCOORD_0` shows that the upper-left portion of the texture image is represented by texture coordinates ranging from roughly `0.0` to roughly `0.4`.

```
{
    "name": "TopLeft_TEXCOORD_0",
    "bufferView" : 7,
    "componentType" : 5126,
    "count" : 4,
    "max" : [
        0.3999999463558197,
        0.3999999761581421
    ],
    "min" : [
        7.915305388905836e-08,
        0.0
    ],
    "type" : "VEC2"
},
```
