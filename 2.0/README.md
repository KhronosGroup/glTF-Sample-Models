| Model                                                  | Screenshot                                                      | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Triangle Without Indices](TriangleWithoutIndices)     | ![](TriangleWithoutIndices/screenshot/screenshot.png)           | The simplest possible glTF asset: A single `scene` with a single `node` and a single `mesh` with a single `mesh.primitive` with a single triangle with a single attribute, without indices and without a `material` |
| [Triangle](Triangle)                                   | ![](Triangle/screenshot/screenshot.png)                         | A very simple glTF asset: The basic structure is the same as in [Triangle Without Indices](TriangleWithoutIndices), but here, the `mesh.primitive` describes an *indexed* geometry
| [Animated Triangle](AnimatedTriangle)                  | ![](AnimatedTriangle/screenshot/screenshot.gif)                 | This sample is similar to the [Triangle](Triangle), but the `node` has a `rotation` property that is modified with a simple `animation` |
| [Animated Morph Cube](AnimatedMorphCube)               | ![](AnimatedMorphCube/screenshot/screenshot.gif)                | Demonstrates a simple cube with two simple morph targets and an animation that transitions between them both. |
| [Animated Morph Sphere](AnimatedMorphSphere)           | ![](AnimatedMorphSphere/screenshot/screenshot.gif)              | This sample is similar to the [Animated Morph Cube](AnimatedMorphCube), but the two morph targets move many more vertices and are more extreme than with the cube. |
| [Simple Meshes](SimpleMeshes)                          | ![](SimpleMeshes/screenshot/screenshot.png)                     | A simple `scene` with two `nodes`, both containing the same `mesh`, namely a `mesh` with a single `mesh.primitive` with a single indexed triangle with *multiple* attributes (positions, normals and texture coordinates), but without a `material` |
| [Simple Morph](SimpleMorph)                            | ![](SimpleMorph/screenshot/screenshot.png)                      | A triangle with a morph animation applied |
| [Simple Sparse Accessor](SimpleSparseAccessor)         | ![](SimpleSparseAccessor/screenshot/screenshot.png)             | A simple mesh that uses sparse accessors |
| [Cameras](Cameras)                                     | ![](Cameras/screenshot/screenshot.png)                          | A sample with two different `camera` objects |
| [Interpolation Test](InterpolationTest)                | ![](InterpolationTest/screenshot/screenshot.gif)                | A sample with three different `animation` interpolations |
