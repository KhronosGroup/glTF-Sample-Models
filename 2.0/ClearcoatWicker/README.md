## Description

This model is a sphere using the glTF extension [`KHR_materials_clearcoat`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_clearcoat) to create a wicker material covered with a wrinkled plastic clearcoat, to demonstrate the usage of a clearcoat bump texture.
